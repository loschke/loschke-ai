## Update Process

1. **Backup your project** before proceeding
2. Run the automated upgrade tool:
   ```bash
   npx @astrojs/upgrade
   ```
3. Alternatively, update manually:
   ```bash
   npm install astro@latest
   ```
4. Update dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install @astrojs/node@latest @astrojs/tailwind@latest
   ```

## Configuration Changes to Consider

### Trailing Slash Redirects
Your current configuration already has `trailingSlash: 'never'`, which will now automatically redirect URLs with trailing slashes to the non-trailing slash version.

### Remote Image Optimization
Remote image optimization in Markdown is enabled by default in 5.4+, so no configuration changes are needed.

### Tailwind 4 Support (If Upgrading Tailwind)
If you want to upgrade to Tailwind 4, you'll need to:
1. Uninstall the @astrojs/tailwind integration
2. Install Tailwind 4 and the Vite plugin
3. Update your Astro config

```bash
# Remove the integration
npm uninstall @astrojs/tailwind

# Install Tailwind 4 and the Vite plugin
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest @tailwindcss/vite
```

Then update your astro.config.mjs:
```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite';
import node from '@astrojs/node';

export default defineConfig({
  // ... other config
  vite: {
    plugins: [tailwindcss()],
    // ... other vite config
  },
  // ... rest of your config
});
```

### Allowlist Hosts for Dev/Preview (Optional Security Enhancement)
```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  // ... other config
  server: {
    allowedHosts: ['loschke.ai', 'www.loschke.ai', 'localhost']
  },
  // ... rest of your config
});
```

## Bug Fixes and Improvements
Each version from 5.1 to 5.6 includes numerous bug fixes and improvements that will benefit your project even without configuration changes.

## Testing Recommendations
After updating:
1. Test your site in development mode
2. Verify all pages render correctly
3. Check image optimization is working as expected
4. Test any API endpoints
5. Perform a test build and preview
6. Verify redirects are working correctly
